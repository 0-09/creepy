##Description: 
geolocation information aggregator.

creepy is an application that allows you to gather geolocation related information about users from social networking platforms and image hosting services. The information is presented in a map inside the application where all the retrieved data is shown accompanied with relevant information (i.e. what was posted from that specific location) to provide context to the presentation.

    *Twitter's tweet location
        **Coordinates when tweet was posted from mobile device
        **Place (geographical name) derived from users ip when posting on twitter's web interface. Place gets translated into coordinates using geonames.com
        **Bounding Box derived from users ip when posting on twitter's web interface.The less accurate source , a corner of the bounding box is selected randomly.
    *Geolocation information accessible through image hosting services API
    *EXIF tags from the photos posted.
